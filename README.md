VIPApulseshaper
===============

Rayleigh-Sommerfeld scalar diffraction applied to a Virtually Imaged
Phased Array pulse shaper.  For example output, see
vipaps_fourier_plane.png, which shows the optical intensity (arb. dB
units) at the Fourier plane of the pulse shaper.

This information about the field is a new result, and informs the way
that high-resolution pulse shapers (for manipulating ultrafast laser
pulses) will be designed.  It will be submitted as part of a paper
that is currently in progress.

Usage:  matlab -nodesktop < vipaps.m

For an open-source option, this will probably also run in Octave with
minor modifications.
